		<p class="SkyhookMono-bold-normal">My name is Katia Pase. I am an editor and I mainly make magazines and journals and books. Currently, I edit Australia's premier graphic design magazine <i>desktop</i>, and I am the co-editor of one of Australia's longest-running literary journals <i>Going Down Swinging</i>.</p>

		 <p>A few years ago I co-founded the Stilts collective while living in Brisbane. The collective championed Queensland writing online and across four unique print publications, and went on to grow the popular live storytelling event, <i>Yarn</i>.</p> 

		 <p>I've curated and presented on various panels and festivals including The Brisbane Writers Festival, The Emerging Writers Festival, The National Young Writers Festival, The Wheeler Centre's Debut Mondays, and the Readings bookstore event series, <i>Journal Assembly</i>. I also give occasional letures and I teach in the Department of Culture and Communication at the University of Melbourne.</p>  

		 <p>My writing has been shortlisted for prizes including the QANTAS Spirit of Youth Awards, and has appeared in publications including <i>SPOOK</i> and <i>The Lifted Brow</i>.</p> 

		 <p>Here you can find some of my work. It is also the work of my collaborators: designers, photographers, authors and other editors.</p>
